### TicTacToe

Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be playable in the command line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11. It should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".

This is a simple demonstration of how the game works:

You can choose how you want your game to look. The simplest is to create a game board using "|" and "_" symbols. But the design is up to you. 

This is a more advanced layout:

If you have more time, you can challenge yourself to build an AI player to play the game with you.

### Questions (after prodction)
Reflection Time:

This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.

Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

### Design
I want an interesting layout not a simple one. At firse we need a background image (grid) and image for circle and cross. We can use a HTML Table with a background and two icons to dray images.

HTML Table may be 3 rows x 3 columns. It will have one bold line and two bold columns:
____ ____ ____

    II    II
______________
______________

    II    II
____ ____ ____

The grid will be 600 width x 400 height wirh a light background cyan/blue. Row and two columns in cyan bold as in the image
